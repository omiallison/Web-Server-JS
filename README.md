HOW TO USE:
-----------------------
I personally use Visual Studio Code: Insiders. Feel free to use whatever suits your fancy.

First, you will need to make a port in 'server.js'. 
The port number does NOT need to be a certain number, 
it just specifies what the web server is running on.

Next, go over to 'page.html' and make/paste your html 
code into there, edit 'style.css' as needed.

After that, everything should be set up. Head over to the terminal and type 'node server.js'. This will launch the web server on a localhost domain.
